![Fact of the Day](/images/fact_of_the_day.png)

Growing list of fact of the days for my discord server.
Everyone is free to add and instructions on how to add a fact is down below!

## Instructions on how to add a fact-

- Go to ```Community posted facts/```
- Create a new file with the "Create new file" button

![Create new file](/images/create_new_file.png)
- Rename the file to your username and end it with / to create a folder

- Rename again to `Fact_#.txt` where the # is what number the fact is starting from 1. I know in the image it has it as `fact_#.txt`, but please make the "F" upercase. Makes it sort correctly when I mark them as used.

- Type in your new fact of the day. Only post 1 fact per file so that it is easier to search through and keep nots of what ones have been used.
